                Hi! I am a Computer Science student at the University of Texas at Dallas. I enjoy writing programs 
                that enable people to be creative at higher rates of speed. 
                I started my programming journey with C/C++ with a strong interest in games and game hacking, over time I've moved 
                towards modding and writing graphical tools to automate (or totally remove) parts of creative workflows that are 
                sluggish. The time savings, optimization, and reaction from users feeling the difference in their workflow is what 
                drives me to continue honing my craft. I have also taken up Rust as my prefered language recently, which I am excited to practice and 
                eventually know it better than I know C++.

                Custom Heads-Up-Display
                System</h1>
            <div style="">
                <p class="text-white " style="text-indent: 2em; align-self: center;">
                    This is a showcase of
                    the
                    standard workings
                    of the WaW HUD features
                    reimplemented in BO3 Lua.
                    Bo3 made no effort to maintain backwards compatibility with the old gsc/menu system, so a lot of
                    things
                    don't "just work". I needed to fiddle with the code a lot and reverse engineer both the LUI (Lua UI)
                    API
                    and the game binary to understand how to approach the endless roadblocks and strangeness of this
                    game.
                    For instance, around the 0:14 mark, I pull out the flamethrower to showcase the widget in the
                    lower-right corner that mimics the World at War aesthetic. I had to re-write this widget since my
                    initial method involved asking the server how much fuel had been used, then sending that info back
                    to
                    the client using it. I later found a better way to do this that totally eliminated the round-trip
                    and
                    increased the smoothness because now it could cheaply update the fuel usage at 60hz instead of 20hz.
                    This scenario happened <i>a lot</i> since there is no documentation, so I ended up having to go back
                    and
                    rewrite earlier versions of code that were extremely hacky and sorta buggy almost constantly, as
                    while
                    working on other parts.

                    There were also rather mysterious performance bugs involving fonts. To recreate the unique look and
                    feel
                    of the classic HUD, I found and downloaded a TTF that looked a lot like the font used in WaW,
                    however
                    when using that font, the *whole game* would stutter incessantly. If you notice on the lower-right
                    bottom of the screen again, when I kill a zombie there is a points number that "scrolls" to the new
                    value. That is the main UI element that really uses that font. It seems small, but that actually
                    took me
                    2 weeks of long debugging sessions between homework and class to figure out the root of the issue
                    and
                    get performance back to where it should be. Of course, I figured out that the TTF file itself was
                    very
                    strange... and I replaced it with a different TTF of the same font and all the issues went away! I
                    can
                    only speculate, but I think the TTF I originally used just didn't play nice with the HarfBuzz text
                    shaping engine, and when the number scrolling happens it takes a VERY slow code path. Unfortunately
                    Bo3
                    has lots of antidebug crap in it, and tools like RenderDoc and Intel GPA just make the game close
                    when
                    they install their hooks or open a handle to the process, so I can't really be 100% certain.

                    Overall, overcoming these challenges taught me a lot about patience and perseverance, and I am proud
                    of
                    how accurate the result is to the original game.

                BGFX rendering backend
                for

                <p class="text-white " style="text-indent: 2em; align-self: center;">
                    needed a UI library that was simple
                    to use and was written in Rust. I found egui, which takes heavy inspiration from ImGui. It provides
                    familiar immediate-mode UI concepts combined with the robustness Rust provides, making it perfect
                    for my
                    project. The only issue was that there was not an existing integration for egui that would work with
                    my
                    current graphics stack (bgfx), so I had to write it myself. This was a challenge because I had only
                    been
                    writing Rust for about half of a week when I started, never written a complete rendering backend for
                    a UI library,
                    and it was my first time using BGFX. Even with all that against me in just a couple weeks (and a few
                    rough hours debugging in RenderDoc...) I was able to get everything working perfectly and this is
                    the result:

            Android App</h1>
        <div>
            <p class="text-white mx-5 px-10" style="text-indent: 2em;">
                This commission tracker app was developed for my girlfriend, who is a freelance artist. She
                complained to me she was getting so many clients it was becoming hard to keep track of them.
                The problem was her clients come from many different platforms, so scrolling
                through her direct messages on the different platforms trying to remember who said what and where
                was too much mental overhead. I really enjoy finding
                ways to use my skills to help others, so I had the idea to develop an Android app to help her keep
                track of it all more easily. Before this undertaking, I had never written any kind of mobile
                application, so I had to learn a lot of new things and adjust to a smaller screensize than I
                normally develop for. The technology stack I
                settled on was NativeScript Vue, however I did try React Native and Expo while researching what
                tools I would need. Android apps also have different filesystem and permissions models, so to
                implement the essential 'save' feature, I had to do a bit of research. Feedback from the girlfriend:
                <i><q>It’s excellent for keeping track of commissions , helps with time and budget management as
                        well.
                        It’s easy to use and efficient
                    </q>
                </i>
