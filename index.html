                System:</h1>
            <p class="text-white mx-5 px-10">This is a showcase of the standard workings of the WaW HUD features
                reimplemented in BO3 Lua.
                Bo3 made no effort to maintain backwards compatibility with the old gsc/menu system, so a lot of things
                don't "just work". I needed to fiddle with the code a lot and reverse engineer both the LUI (Lua UI) API
                and the game binary to understand how to approach the endless roadblocks and strangeness of this game.
                For instance, around the 0:14 mark, I pull out the flamethrower to showcase the widget in the
                lower-right corner that mimics the World at War aesthetic. I had to re-write this widget since my
                initial method involved asking the server how much fuel had been used, then sending that info back to
                the client using it. I later found a better way to do this that totally eliminated the round-trip and
                increased the smoothness because now it could cheaply update the fuel usage at 60hz instead of 20hz.
                This scenario happened *a lot* since there is no documentation, so I ended up having to go back and
                rewrite earlier versions of code that were extremely hacky and sorta buggy almost constantly, as while
                working on other parts.

                There were also rather mysterious performance bugs involving fonts. To recreate the unique look and feel
                of the classic HUD, I found and downloaded a TTF that looked a lot like the font used in WaW, however
                when using that font, the *whole game* would stutter incessantly. If you notice on the lower-right
                bottom of the screen again, when I kill a zombie there is a points number that "scrolls" to the new
                value. That is the main UI element that really uses that font. It seems small, but that actually took me
                2 weeks of long debugging sessions between homework and class to figure out the root of the issue and
                get performance back to where it should be. Of course, I figured out that the TTF file itself was very
                strange... and I replaced it with a different TTF of the same font and all the issues went away! I can
                only speculate, but I think the TTF I originally used just didn't play nice with the HarfBuzz text
                shaping engine, and when the number scrolling happens it takes a VERY slow code path. Unfortunately Bo3
                has lots of antidebug crap in it, and tools like RenderDoc and Intel GPA just make the game close when
                they install their hooks or open a handle to the process, so I can't really be 100% certain.

                Overall, overcoming these challenges taught me a lot about patience and perseverance, and I am proud of
                how accurate the result is to the original game.</p>
