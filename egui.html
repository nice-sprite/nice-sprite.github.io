    <h1>EGUI Renderer</h1>
    <p>
        Before I started working on LUI Editor, I was investigating the Rust ecosystem and found
        <code>bgfx</code> and <code>egui</code> as candidates for the technology components I would use in the final product.
        Below is a the demo program I wrote to test what it would be like to use <code>egui</code>. 
        Everything is rendered using the Rust bindings for <code>bgfx</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the end, I decided that the Rust ecosystem was not mature enough to support what I wanted to accomplish and retired the idea. I 
        did, however, enjoy combining these two libraries and learned a lot while doing it!

            <p>This demo gif shows that textures, vertex data, and platform data are all working correctly. In addition you can see the rough beginnings of the app I wanted to build. </p>
