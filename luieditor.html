    <h1>LUI Editor</h1>
    <p>This is a showcase of features I implemented in my tool that I am proud of.
        Almost all of the code is from-scratch, the only libraries I heavily rely on are Freetype and Harfbuzz.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Live Reload</h3>
            <p>The editor is split into 2 parts<br>
                 <code style="color: purple">luieditor.exe</code> - acts as a "host", stores long-lived data such as the current UI scene, graphics API objects, etc. <br>
                 <code style="color: darkorange">engine.dll</code> - contains the bulk of the program, eg. scene layout, editor UI, camera code, input handling</p>
                 <code style="color: darkorange">engine.dll</code> exports 3 functions to luieditor.exe, <code>on_load(), update_and_render(), on_unload()</code>. 
                 Once luieditor.exe loads the dll and gets the 3 exports with <code>GetProcAddress</code>, it calls on_load, executes the typical win32 window loop while calling <code>update_and_render()</code>, and when the program exits it called <code>on_unload()</code>.

            <h3>Multithreaded Asset Import</h3>
            <p>One of the most common tasks a user will do is use the asset browser to add specific images to their UI scene. 
                This involves waiting on the disk, memory, and image parsing (stb_image) to load the image for use, which takes way longer than 1 frame to finish. 
                I added a dedicated asset loading thread that enables loading very large images, or whole directories full of large images, without 
                any hitching or blocking the main input/render thread of the program. I am proud of how simple the implementation is.  <br>

            <h3>SDF Font Atlas</h3>
            <p>Since the LUI editor allows users to zoom in and closely inspect their work, it was important to me that fonts 
                scale efficiently and smoothly. I used Freetype to implement signed distance field fonts and rolled my own simple font atlas generator on top of it. There's still improvements and bug fixes to be made, but 
                overall the quality is good, fonts render fast, and layout is <i>mostly</i> working! <br>
                Here it is in action, with a cute IDA Pro inspired background gradient as well!
